### How to play
The game is ready to be played with a mouse in PC, although it works in smartphones.
The game consists on managing the wellbeing of the beach: people will be coming in and out and there are four main mechanics that you have to be aware of:
- **Don't let the shops be out** of stock by pressing them for a few seconds with the mouse.
- **Don't let people misbehave in the water** (you can see that when they splash) by dragging the whistle from the lifeguard to the person.
- **Don't let the beach be full of rubbish**, you can clean it by dragging the rubbish to the bins.
- In addition, you will earn money to buy more shops, bins and lifeguards.
